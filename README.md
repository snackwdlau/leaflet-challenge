# leaflet-challenge
This exercise use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet to create maps visualizations displaying data based on earthquakes and tectonic plates.

**Findings:** The visualizations created can help experts predict and determine natural disasters caused my tectonic plates. Benefits from these predictions can prevent casualties and better prepare people from disasters such as earthquakes. Based on the findings, areas closer to tectonic plates' borders contains a higher volume of earthquakes. 

### Background 
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Instructions
This activity is broken down into two deliverables: 
* **Part 1:** Create the Earthquake Visualization
